# Project Overview: Code MD201-4

## Busmall App

### User Stories

People have their own individual **interests** and **needs**, but not all individuals like the same things so we have to improvise and see if what is the kind of taste is the most popular; i.e shoes, candles, etc.

This is how the **Busmall App** emerged. The team interviewed three individual that belongs to their each of their own respective groups, which are:
    - A college student
    - 52-year old caucasian woman
    - A social reformer

**Busmall App** provides a survey using only a set of three pictures that are random that applies to the interests of the said groups. If the user _"clicks"_ one photo, a new set of random three photos will pop out to be clicked again. Once the user reach a certain amount of clicks, a chart will appear and then will show what image that belongs on a certain group of interests is the most selected. 

## Problem Domain

-`Interview Team`: a team which interviews the selected individuals that belong to different respected groups. Asking them and acquiring the knowledge of their personal interests.

-`Developers`: a development team was tasked with the challenge of bringing **Bites'n Bethesda** to life. They are the _brains_ behind the `technical requirements` and innovations of the application.
